# Team-5

## Welcome to Ctrl - R

### So far we have decided that our main deliverables for this project are

    1. Assessments
    2. Incentives
    3. Integrations

### 5 pm stand up

- William And Akshar are working on the Login Page
- Jonathon, Jay, and Natalia are working on the student page
- See pictures of board for more information.

# Design Notes

- Login page currently routes to Admin page if username is -1 and routes to student page of the corresponding studentId. If username is not a valid studentId it routes to student 1. Password is irrelevant.

## How to get backend working

- install node js
- cd into api folder
- run 'npm i -g nodemon'
- run 'nodemon index.js'
